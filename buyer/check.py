"""The part that says no: seven fields of the prepared purchase against the pinned intent.

Each check returns a `FieldResult`. A refusal names the field and BOTH values: what was
asked (from the pin) and what was found (in the prepared bytes). "Cannot buy" is not a
refusal; "price_raw: asked at most 2000000, prepared 3000000" is.

Two checks are written as worked examples: `check_program` and `check_store`. The other
five are yours. Until you write one it raises `NotYetWritten`, and `check_all` treats that
as a refusal: an unwritten check never lets a signature through.
